            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>My name is Ashraaf and my wife's name is Aniqa. We have been married for 16 years
                and manage to keep the flame going by embarking on remarkeable journeys together.
                In 2009 after 4 years of marriage and 30 years living in sunny and picturesque Cape Town, South
                Africa we packed a suitcase each and came to the UK where our internationl travel journey began.
                This site intends to share with you those travel experiences. Bear with us as we get the site
                updated with our travel experiences of the last 12 years.
                Head over to the Contact Us page for any feedback or last minute advice.</p>
