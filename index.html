            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>My name is Ashraaf and my wife's name is Aniqa. We have been married for 16 years
                and manage to keep the flame going by embarking on remarkeable journeys together.
                In 2009 after 4 years of marriage and 30 years living in sunny and picturesque Cape Town, South
                Africa we packed a suitcase each and came to the UK where our internationl travel journey began.
                This site intends to share with you those travel experiences. Bear with us as we get the site
                updated with our travel experiences of the last 12 years.
                Head over to the Contact Us page for any feedback or last minute advice.</p>

        <h2 class="header-center">Our Reasons for Travel</h2>
        <div id="left-reason">
            <h3 class="header-center">Make Memories <i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i></h3>
            <p>We love the fact that we can look back and laugh for the times we got lost in a foreign country, playback our near misses for flights and cherish the moments we were awe inspired by the food and knowledge we gained on our travels.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="right-reason">
            <h3 class="header-center">Be Serendipitous <i class="fas fa-running"></i></h3>
            <p>Forget about what could go wrong. Take a leap of faith.I don't say you should rob a bank and hope you get away with it! Explore a new country, do your research to limit risks and be safe. Go on that boat ride or try a new cuisine. You won't know if you like something until you have tried it.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="center-reason">
            <h3 class="header-center">Unwind & Appreciate <i class="fas fa-couch"></i></h3>
            <p>Travelling gives us a sense of appreciation. Aniqa and I have learnt to appreciate the luxuries in our lives like having a meal, safe place to live, WiFi... Travelling reminds us how furtunate we are especially when we step out of our daily routine and have the time to unwind and reflect.</p>
