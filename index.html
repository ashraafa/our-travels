                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p><span>My name is Ashraaf and I am married to Aniqa who is a beautiful, kind and in many ways, a
                        remarkable wife. We
                        have been married for 16 years and manage to keep the flame going through compromise and
                        understanding but most importantly,
                        sharing memorable experiences.</span></p>
                <p>In 2009 after 4 years of marriage and 30 years living in sunny and picturesque Cape Town, South
                    Africa, we packed a suitcase each and came to the UK where our international travel journey
                    began.</p>
                <p><span>This website intends to share with you those travel experiences and hopefully inspire you. Bear
                        with us as we get the content
                        updated with our travel experiences of the last 12 years.</span></p>

                    about any of our travel experiences.

            <h2>Our Reasons for Travel</h2>
            <div id="left-reason">
                <h3>Memories <i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i></h3>
                <p>We love the fact that we can look back and laugh at the times we got lost in a foreign country,
                    our luggage went missing or when we were awe inspired by the food we ate and knowledge
                    we gained</p>
                <p><span>"These are the moments we cherish."</span></p>
            </div>
            <div id="right-reason">
                <h3>Adventures <i class="fas fa-running"></i></h3>
                <p>Forget about what could go wrong and take a leap of faith. I don't say you should rob a bank and hope
                    you
                    get away with it! Explore a new country, do your research and be safe. </p>
                <p><span>"You won't know if you like something until you have tried it."</span></p>
            </div>
            <div id="center-reason">
                <h3>Appreciate <i class="fas fa-couch"></i></h3>
                <p>Travelling gives us a sense of appreciation. Aniqa and I have learnt to appreciate the luxuries in
                    our daily lives which includes having a daily meal, a safe place to live and WiFi! Travelling
                    reminds us.</p>
                <p><span>"We have the opportunity to see the world from a different perspective."</span></p>
